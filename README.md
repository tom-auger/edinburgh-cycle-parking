# Edinburgh Cycle Parking

Static, mobile-friendly Next.js app for finding nearby City of Edinburgh Council cycle parking.

The app has no backend. It ships a normalized copy of the public ArcGIS Cycle Parking dataset and sorts locations in the browser using the Geolocation API when the user shares their current location.

The app is installable as a Progressive Web App. On Android, supported browsers show an install prompt; on iOS, use Safari's Add to Home Screen flow. After a first successful load, the app shell and bundled parking data are available offline, but live place search and uncached map tiles still need a network connection.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Common checks:

```bash
pnpm test
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm build
```

## Dataset

Refresh the static dataset with:

```bash
pnpm update:data
```

The script downloads GeoJSON from the City of Edinburgh Council ArcGIS service, normalizes it, and writes `src/data/cycle-parking.json`.

## Deployment

The app is configured for GitHub Pages project hosting.

Local static export:

```bash
pnpm build
```

On GitHub Actions the deploy workflow sets `GITHUB_PAGES=true`, which enables the `/edinburgh-cycle-parking` base path and publishes the generated `out/` directory.
